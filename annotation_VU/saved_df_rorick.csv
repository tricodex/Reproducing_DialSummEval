"<br><br> Brett: So what do u do there? Drive a tank all the time? <br><br> John: Yes and no. U've got players from around the world and they have their tank squadrons and u battle them. Can be a lot of fun! <br><br> Andrew: So what happens if someone is on a higher level than u? They basically destroy u! <br><br> John: That's not a problem. The game doesn't allow higher ranked players o interact with players out of their range. <br><br> Brett: What do u mean? <br><br> John: If ur on lvl 5, a player on lvl 30 can't attack u.  <br><br> Andrew: Sensible. Unlike WoW. <br><br> John: So what's WoW like? <br><br> Andrew: Imagine having a character u rly like and u give it a lot of ur attention and get experience point, level up and so on.
